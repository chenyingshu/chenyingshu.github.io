Test Platform: Windows 10
<br>
Insight:
<br>
<p><img src="../images/miscellaneous/t5.jpg" width="100%" alt=""></p>
*Not sensitive for all sensors (Solved)
<br>
*Easy to lose connection (Bluetooth) (Solved, charge enough, charge to activate)
<p></p>

EPOC+:
<br>
<p><img src="../images/miscellaneous/t6.jpg" width="100%" alt=""></p>
*Tested with USB dongle.
<br>
*Hard to connect well, and the best statue is still connected intermittently. 
<br>
*Sensors need fully hydrated. (As shown above, left sensors are more hydrated than right ones)
<br>
*Need half an hour to connect and keep closely touching scalps, especially sensors that near ears.
<br>
*Rear two sensors are hard to activated.
<br>
*Wear firmly or loose contact. Surface of sensors should be fully touched with scalp.
<br>
<br>

TESTS:
<br>
TEST 1 Mental Commands
<br>
<p><img src="../images/miscellaneous/t7.jpg" width="100%" alt=""></p>
*If only command by thinking, it is not easy to tell the differences.
<br>
*Cannot detect Glance left, Glance right, Laugh, Smirk (left side), Smirk (right side) 
<br>
*Thinking dynamic actions is better detected than thinking static ones.
<br>
* More engagement is better detected and differentiated.
<br>

***Instructions from official site: <a href="https://emotiv.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/201222435-How-do-I-train-multiple-actions-"> https://emotiv.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/201222435-How-do-I-train-multiple-actions-</a>
<br>
Master one action and then another one. Neutral state to be relaxed and act naturally.
<br>
Acting is easier to be detected than thinking.
<br>
<br>

TEST 2 Facial expression
<br>
<p><img src="../images/miscellaneous/t8.jpg" width="70%" alt=""></p>
*Work badly, little response. With better training, it responses better and more precisely.
<br>
*It can detect expressions like smile, frown, blink, clench, surprise to some extent.
<br>
**If change the headset like EPOC, the trained data for Insight are not available for EPOC.
<br>
<br>
 

TEST 3 Inertial Sensor
<br>
<p><img src="../images/miscellaneous/t9.jpg" width="100%" alt=""></p>
*Orientation detection, movement detection is good. (detect the acceleration)
<br>
*Good detection even with bad connect quality. (as figured showed below)
<br>

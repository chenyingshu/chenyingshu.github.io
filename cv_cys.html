        <p>Interactive game concept design including prototype | Charged in game layout design</p>
        <p>Game programing design – Flash game / animation | Scenes and characters 3D and 2D modelling, code programing</p>

        <p>Game programming design – 3D virtual Unity game with Oculus | Scenes and characters 3D and 2D modelling, dubbing</p>

<!--        <p>The realization of images combination and mergence with wavelet transform in Matlab</p>-->
<!--        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>-In Matlab, under wavelet transform theory, the combination of two images is realized, with different degrees of mergence through linear transform. Continuous displaying of images mergence in different levels comes to special effect of gradual change if two images, which could finally automatically produce animation without Matlab. Besides, some particular application designs are made followed this series of techniques above.</small><br>-->

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>-Study the effect of user interface (UI) elements and human-induced factors on electroencephalography (EEG) signals, proposing a brain-computer interface (BCI) typing system through EEG data retrieved from the wireless Emotiv neuroheadset. Mixing with UI factorial auxiliaries and the T9 keyboard layout, a new input UI was devised in terms of performance of the neuroheadset and input efficiency. Innovative ideas about enhancing training brainwave signals through visual, auditory and motional assistance were proposed. Research was made on possibility of convenient BCI applications through UI elements, anthropic assistance and extra functions auxiliaries based on consumer-EEG device, discovering connections between neural signals and human-induced effects.</small><br>

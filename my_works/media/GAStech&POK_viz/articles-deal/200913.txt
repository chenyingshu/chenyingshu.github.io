ABILA, Kronos - Kronos police arrested Elian Karel today on charges of tax evasion.  Karel, the leader of the activist group "Protectors of Kronos", was conducting a meeting with his supporters when he was arrested.  Karel's lawyer, Michale Kraft, released a statement declaring that the charges against his client were false and that he hoped to have Karel released from police custody by week's end.  It is clear that Elian Karel, who professes to have the interests of the people of Kronos at heart, must explain to us why he refuses to contribute to the welfare of his nation.

Filled of fuel by a dissatisfaction growing with regard to the awkward government with Kronosian, it started to lead the POK in an organization action-based, instead of one awaiting their government to make the aright things.

Karel died Wednesday while serving time in prison. The government of Kronos refuses the comment on the circumstances of its death.

Rather charismatic, Karel could inspire a crowd and draw attention to the social and political agenda of POK.  It could also tickle the funny bone of its assistances.  Once, after Jr. of Sten Sanjorge of PRESIDENT de GAStech compared the POK with a group of terrorist in an interview of pressure, Karel scoffed, "Sanjorge is a brilliant chief of GAStech. Do you know why it takes a scale with him with the supermarket?  It heard that the prices of foodstuffs in Abila are really high."

It looks like the death of Karel will be swept under the same rug that hides the graft and corruption that has increasingly plagued our country for the last several years.

ELODIS, KRONOS: WILL THE GOVERNMENT RESPOND IN TIME? 



1998/05/15


This article is the last installment of a three-part series addressing the growing problem of one community's anguish, government malfeasance, and the alarming influence of multinational corporations on the country of Kronos.  I've asked him to tell me about the involvement of the government of Kronos in the deeply troubling account of a community's struggle for protection from those who should help them the most: their elected officials, against those who would poison their children and the country's food. 

"It took a long time for anyone to respond," Reese tells me of their struggle.  "Henk Bodrogi - the man you met - didn't give up.  He called every department that could possibly be associated with our problem:  interior, justice, foreign affairs, health.  Finally, a sympathetic person from the Ministry of Health answered the door, so that's where we started." 

Reese then describes months of meetings at which the government officials demanded documents proving their case:  health and crop yield statistics, the scientific test results from Wellness For All, and medical records.  We bring the documents they want, and then they want to confirm the results, or tell us to provide additional information or have closed door meetings.  We're currently in the process of negotiating a date for a hearing at the Ministry of Health to present our petition for assistance." 

"You tell me," Reese nods out his window.

GASTECH EMPLOYEE INTERROGATED, RELEASED 

 

2014/01/20
 

ABILA, Kronos - For roughly 6 hours GAStech - Kronos employee Edvard Vann was interrogated by Kronos Police and Government officials before being released at 17:00 this evening. The apparent confusion stems from the similarity between his name and that of a Protector of Kronos member. 

 

Vann, a security guard for GAStech, was furious, stating, "I have nothing to do whatsoever with any members of the terrorist group POK. I was born here in Abila and I support my government and my president. Being accused and being interrogated for 6 hours as a terrorist POK member is one of the worst days of my life. With some 14 GAStech employees still unaccounted for, one cannot blame the police or the government for not leaving any stone unturned.

20 January 2014

ABILA, Kronos - A long tense day of conflicting reports and confusing information has come to an end. What we know for certain is that 14 GAStech employees are not only missing, but kidnapped as confirmed by a Kronos Government source. At this time it is unclear who the missing are and whether they are citizens of Kronos of Tethys, as many GAStech employees are Tethan.

There is still speculation regarding who was taken in the kidnapping and whether GAStech President and CEO Sten Sanjorge Jr. was the target, given that GAStech International has yet to make a statement to the press. Speculation about the motives of the kidnappers has been rampant due to the recent news of the GAStech Initial Public Offering only a month ago.

At this time no one has claimed responsibility for the kidnapping. Edvard Vann, a GAStech - Kronos security guard who was interrogated and released after 6 hours, gave the indication that the Protectors of Kronos were involved or at least suspected as being the perpetrators behind today's events.

A GAStech International senior security executive has been on site to support the investigation aiding the Abila Police Department and Kronos Government officials.

January 20th was GAStech's annual corporate meeting with a Kronos Government reception to follow. Shortly after the morning meeting ended at 10:00, Abila Fire Department trucks responded to reports of a fire at the GAStech office.

Update, 5:30 PM:  We have several reports from GAStech employees that confirm a kidnapping took place, but at this time there is no information on who was involved.  Unofficial reports from the police indicate that they believe the Protectors of Kronos (POK) are behind the kidnapping and that they requested government assistance with the investigation.  We have received no information which could confirm the POK's role in this alleged kidnapping, but note that they have grown increasingly violent over the past 5 years.

1732 UPDATE - Much of the information gathered from the GAStech employees who have been allowed to leave by police investigators point to a kidnapping of several GAStech employees. However, officials still have not confirmed a kidnapping has taken place. The number of missing employees is undetermined at this time given the earlier confusion with the false fire alarm.
There is some indication that the Protectors of Kronos - an activist group responsible for many recent demonstrations and riots in and around Abila - are suspected of being responsible for the kidnapping. If true, this is an alarming escalation of violence for the activist group.
